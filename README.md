This repository demonstrates a basic Git workflow using a simple web project example. It was created as an exercise to practice the following concepts:

* Creating and cloning a repository on GitHub.
* Working with branches (`development`, `feature`) to isolate the development of new functionality.
* Adding files and making commits in different branches.
* Merging branches (`git merge`) to integrate changes.
* Using GitHub for remote code storage and synchronization.
* Working with Pull Requests (although the process was adapted due to the initial absence of the `main` branch).
* Resolving potential issues (e.g., changing the default branch on GitHub).
* Cleaning up the repository by deleting completed branches.

## Files Created

The following files were created during this exercise:

* `test.py`: A simple Python script added in the `development` branch.
* `feature.html`: A basic HTML page added in the `feature` branch.
* `.gitignore`: A file to ignore IDE-specific files and folders (e.g., `.idea/`).
* `main.py`: An additional Python script.
* `README.md`: This description file.
